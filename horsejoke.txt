there was this farm
and on the farm was a horse
he wanted to start a band
but he didnt know how to play guitar
so he went to town to try to find someone to teach him
eventually he found a flyer for guitar lessons
so he met with the guy
and he asked, 'im a horse, is that gonna be a problem?'
and the guy said 'ive never taught a horse before, but i can try'
and sure enough, he learned how to play guitar
but one horse isnt enough for a band
but he played his heart out anyway
on the farm was a cow
the cow saw the horse playing guitar and wanted to join
but he didnt know how to play any instuments
he couldnt play guitar, because that would be copying the horse
the horse suggested the guy anyway
so the cow met up with the guy
the cow asked the guy,
'i know you teach guitar,
but i wanna learn the drums'
the guy said,
'if i can teach a horse to play guitar,
i can teach a cow to play the drums'
and sure enough, the cow learned how to play the drums
its starting to become a band! but its missing something
its missing bass
on the farm was a pig
oh a chicken is funnier
nvm the pig was butchered
so they asked the chicken instead
the horse and the cow suggested the guy to the chicken
so the chicken met up with the guy
the guy, knowing how the story goes by now, said
'dont worry, ive taught a horse to play guitar,
and a cow to play drums, i can teach you how to play the bass'
but he couldnt
womp womp
luckily the chicken knew how to play bass anyway
he just wanted to play along with the horse and the cow
so now its a real band
theyre actually very good
the guy is a great teacher
the horse, the cow, and the chicken managed to become famous
theyre going on tours and getting awards
but one day, the horse's mother got sick
so he had to go to his moms house and take care of her
yeah ofc
the horse asked the cow and the chicken to wait for him
to come back before playing any other songs
we'll be back after these short messages
ok anyway
where was i
okay
as you could probably tell, the cow and the chicken didnt listen
they waited a little bit, but the rush of being on stage had gotten to them
they needed more
and more they got
turns out, three's a crowd
and the cow and the chicken were better without the horse
when the horse found out, he was devastated
this was HIS dream, HIS band
that damned cow and that damned chicken stole them both from him
but theres nothing he can do about it
what is one angry wannabe gonna do?
knowing his life was ultimately over, he went to town
and he scoped out the only place he knew where he could forget himself
the horse walked into the bar
and the bartender said
'why the long face?'
